## Welcome to MyMark

MyMark is an online marketplace demo that will serve the following purposes:

1. Show how to develop a simple web application using software architecture best practices. Technically, the project will be based on Java, Spring and other technologies.
2. Enable the creation of a DevOps pipeline that will be used to deploy the application to multiple environments on AWS. 
3. Demonstrate how to take a monolithic application and transform it into a microservices architecture.
4. Tinker with new tools and technologies.
